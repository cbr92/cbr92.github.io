I am a statistics Ph.D. student advised by [David Blei]( http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/index.html). My interests include applications of Bayesian statistics and machine learning to problems in public health and medicine. I have also studied differential privacy with [Marco Avella Medina]( https://sites.google.com/site/marcoavellamedina/home), and I collaborate with [Wesley Tanseyâ€™s lab]( https://componcmsk.org/tansey-lab/) in the computational oncology program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

In 2013 I completed a BA at Dartmouth College, where I studied mathematics and had the opportunity to work in the [Lynch rocket lab]( https://sites.dartmouth.edu/lynch-rocket-lab/).

You can find my CV [here](http://cbr92.github.io/files/cv.pdf).
